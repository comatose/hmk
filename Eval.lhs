Default shell to pass recipes to. The shell used should understand the -e and
-x switches, which means stop executing on first non-zero exit status and
trace execution, respectively.

Targets are either regular files, virtual or patterns. After instantiation of
meta-rules the patterns disappear, leaving only files and virtual targets. But
it cannot be known until after evaluation of all rules whether a target is
virtual or not. However, thanks to lazy evaluation, we can lookup wether a
target is virtual or not now, if we promise to build it later.

> data Target = File { name :: FilePath }
>             | Virtual { name :: String }
>             | Pattern { name :: String }
>             | REPattern { name :: String }
>               deriving Show

> newtype RevAppend a = RevAppend a
>
> instance Monoid a => Monoid (RevAppend a) where
>     mempty = RevAppend mempty
>     mappend (RevAppend x) (RevAppend y) = RevAppend (mappend y x)

Only the name of targets matters when comparing them, so we make equality into
an equivalence relation rather than the default structural equality.

> instance Eq Target where
>     x == y = name x == name y
>
> instance Ord Target where
>     compare x y = compare (name x) (name y)

Variable references are substituted for their values, using the environment.

A list of tokens can be spliced, appended to, etc, to form a new list of
tokens. Freezing means turning a list of tokens into a string, which cannot be
manipulated any further. This string representation is used to export values
to the outside world, such as the system environment.

> freeze :: Seq String -> String
> freeze = intercalate " " . Seq.toList

The environment is a variable store that can be updated in place. It is very
much not a persistent abstraction. We implement it using an internal map
rather than using the system environment directly because using the system
environment would require retokenizing values when we look them up. The
content of this internal map is immediately reflected into the system
environment, however, because assignments that are exported need to be
available to subprocesses forked during sourcing and piping.

Evaluation substitutes values for all variable references, using the system
environment as a variable store. Assignments are executed first, then PRule's
are evaluated to Rule's, the data structure for rules used by Control.Hmk. The
return value is a sequence of functions mapping stems to rules. This is
because stems are synthesized as a by-product of meta-rule instantiaton, but
this instantiation is performed post evaluation.

> data Stem = Stem String | RESubMatches [String] | NoStem
>
> addVariable attr var val = do
>   modify (fmap (Map.insert var (val :: Seq String)))
>   case attr of
>     Export -> liftIO $ setEnv var (freeze val) True
>     Local -> return ()

The value of a variable is looked up by decreasing order of precedence in the
following places:

 - assignments on the command line,
 - assignments in the mkfile,
 - the environment.

A recipe is executed by supplying the recipe as standard input to the shell.
(Note that unlike make, hmk feeds the entire recipe to the shell rather than
running each line of the recipe separately.)

Parsing flags has to be done at evaluation time because we allow variable
references in place of flag characters, for instance to programmatically turn
on or off verbosity of rules, etc. The content of the flags field of a rule is
necessarily either a collation or a literal.

> evalFlags toks = do
>   v <- Seq.msum <$> Seq.mapM evalToken toks
>   return $ interp (freeze v)
>     where interp "" = Set.empty
>           interp ('D':xs) = Set.insert Flag_D (interp xs)
>           interp ('E':xs) = Set.insert Flag_E (interp xs)
>           interp ('N':xs) = Set.insert Flag_N (interp xs)
>           interp ('n':xs) = Set.insert Flag_n (interp xs)
>           interp ('P':xs) = Set.singleton (Flag_P xs)
>           interp ('Q':xs) = Set.insert Flag_Q (interp xs)
>           interp ('R':xs) = Set.insert Flag_R (interp xs)
>           interp ('U':xs) = Set.insert Flag_U (interp xs)
>           interp ('V':xs) = Set.insert Flag_V (interp xs)

A user supplied comparison command is wrapped into an action in the IO monad.

> evalCompare cmp (File x) (File y) = do
>   code <- rawSystem cmp [x, y]
>   case code of
>       ExitSuccess -> return False
>       ExitFailure _ -> return True

The default comparison action.

> isStale (File x) (File y) = IO.isStale x y
> isStale (File x) (Virtual y) = return True
> isStale _ _ = error "impossible."

Version of eval where stems are instantiated to the empty string.
